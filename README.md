**MySQL**: MySQL has been maturing since 1995 and has grown a large following. Some organizations that use MySQL include Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, US Navy, NASA, Walmart, and Paypal.     
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Just like all other relational databases, MySQL uses tables, constraints, triggers, roles, stored procedures and views as the core components that you work with. A table consists of rows, and each row contains a same set of columns. MySQL uses primary keys to uniquely identify each row (a.k.a record) in a table, and foreign keys to assure the referential integrity between two related tables.     
**Mango DB**: MongoDB was released in 2009 and is used by many organizations including Klout, Citrix, Twitter, T-Mobile, Zendesk, Sony, Hootsuite, SurveyMonkey, MuleSoft, Foursquare, and InVision.    
In MongoDB, data is stored in JSON-like documents that can have varied structures. To improve query speed, MongoDB can store related data together, which is accessed using the MongoDB query language. MongoDB is schema-free, allowing you to create documents without having to define the structure of the document first. These documents can be easily changed by adding or deleting fields.
