### Database of Mongo DB and my SQL
The biggest diversion of these two databases is mySQL is a Structured Query Lanuage(SQL), whereas Mango DB is a none structured one. This refers to different methods they use store data. MySQL is table based database, representing data in form of tables which consists of number of rows of data, whereas Mango DB is document based, collection of key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores, which do
not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to. One typical type of file that Mango DB uses to store data is json file.       
**MySQL**: MySQL has been maturing since 1995 and has grown a large following. Some organizations that use MySQL include Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, US Navy, NASA, Walmart, and Paypal.     
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Just like all other relational databases, MySQL uses tables, constraints, triggers, roles, stored procedures and views as the core components that you work with. A table consists of rows, and each row contains a same set of columns. MySQL uses primary keys to uniquely identify each row (a.k.a record) in a table, and foreign keys to assure the referential integrity between two related tables.     


**Mango DB**: Unlike MySQL has a peroid of evolution and maturing, MongoDB wasreleased in 2009 and has been getting widely adopted to solve various business problems in the last several years. Now it is used by many organizations including Klout, Citrix, Twitter, T-Mobile, Zendesk, Sony, Hootsuite, SurveyMonkey, MuleSoft, Foursquare, and InVision.    
Since Mongo DB is none structured query databases, it can store related data together to improve query speed, which then can be accessed using Mongo DB Query lanuage. Mongo DB is also schema-free, allowing you to create documents without having to define the structure of the document first. These documents can be easily changed by adding or deleting fields.
